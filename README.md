# data-representation-the-big-project

This assignment is part of the Data Representation module in GMIT Higher Diploma in Data Analytics.

The goal is to create a web application with a basic Flask server that has:	
- A REST API, (to perform	CRUD operations)
- One database table
- An accompanying web interface using AJAX calls to	perform	these CRUD operations

Additional functionality I have added includes a login feature, configuration file, designed web pages, and some Python files to build the SQL database.

Before starting Flask, I would recommend running the create-database.py and create-car.py files on your computer. Then,, you can start flask by running app.py file. From there, you can work your way through the various CRUD operations and navigate thru the website to check that the app functions as it should.
